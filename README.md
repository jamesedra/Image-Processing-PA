## *Image-Processing-PA*

This repository contains my solution to the CPSC 221 Programming Assignment from UBC. 

# Project Overview
The objective of this assignment was to implement various functions to manipulate a linked list of pixel data from an image. The implementation involved concepts such as vectors, pointers, linked lists, and dynamic memory management.

The assignment required completing the provided code in block.cpp and Chain.cpp, which included functions for building, rendering, flipping, rotating, and manipulating the linked list.

# Project Structure
The repository contains the following files which contains my solution:

    block.cpp: Implementation of functions related to the Block class, including pixel vector manipulation, rendering, flipping, rotating, and dimension retrieval.
    Chain.cpp: Implementation of functions related to the Chain class, including list construction, copying, assignment, destruction, length retrieval, emptiness check, rendering, node insertion, reversing, flipping, and rotating.
    chain_private.h: Declaration of private functions for Chain class implementation details.
    README.md: Overview of the project, assignment details, and instructions for running and contributing to the code.
